# PrivateUtrasonicSpeaker
A project to use ultrasonic speakers to build audible music for personal use or sound projection

This project will be a trailblaser for finding out the feasability of using ultrasound for making a speaker only audible to myself.

I will be recording the research process in the research folder

Photos will be in the photos folder when progress that can be displayed is made.
