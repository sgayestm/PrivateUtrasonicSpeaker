This project will be seperated into several parts:

Firstly the system will need to produce localised audio.
  -This will be handled by the ultrasonic speakers and will be researched seperately

The speakers will need to be driven by a controller. 
  -this will likely need to be a stand alone controller to handle the mathmatics fast enough

The speakers will need to be able to get a audio signal
  - the final goal for this will be getting the music from bluetooth, however for a period of time a mp4 file saved locally might be used
  
	-After some research it became obvious that the choice of untrasonic transducer is important as a larger
	 broadband transducer allows for a larger produced audible broudband without needing to ventrue into advanced signal processing
	 to got the outcome
	
	-The next choice would be the controller used. This would impact the speed of signal processing.
	 This is important since if fast signal processing is needed then a very fast microprocessor would be needed.
	
		Initially I am considering using a stm32 for the signal processing and a esp32 for handling the audio since i have previous experience getting audio to a esp32
